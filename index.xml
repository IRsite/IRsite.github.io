      <description>Background The purpose of these weekly projects is to act as a way for me to learn new skills, refine skills or just work on something small that I am interested in. As I am not spending a great deal of time on them they may not be the cleanest or most effcient, but I hope that through them I can grow my skills in mathematics, computer science and robotics.</description>
