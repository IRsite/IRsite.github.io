I am a recent graduate of Mechatronic Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Queensland with a focus on optimisation and control of systems. I am passionate about intelligent desicion making regarding large scale systems and heavy machinery, as well as computer vision, control of intricate systems and machine learning. 

Throughout university I acted as vice president of the UQ robotics club, a student driven club that runs projects to help people learn robotics, regardless of prior knowledge.
